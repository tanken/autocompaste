## Copy/Paste Experiment

Main experiment site is hosted on http://tanken.github.io/autocompaste/

Participant ID are from P01 - P12, each with pre-defined sets of conditions found in data folder.

## Pre-Experiment Questionnaire

There are 3 sections: Personal Information, Physical Condition & Technical Experience.

In total, there are 15 questions and all are required to be answered so as to help the experimentor understand the participant better. 

## Instructions

Participants are briefed on The Interface, The Techniques: AutoComPaste & Traditional Ctrl+C/V, The Experiment

A diagram is include to allow the particpant to understand the flow of the sequences during each trial.

Keywords relating to important information for the experiment are distinguished by different color highlights.

## Experiment

Experiment doesn't start immediately, so that it doesn't surprise the participant.

Upon clicking the Start Experiment button, the 1st of 108 trials will be run.

As the 3rd Independent Variables test for Within/Across Window text source, the stimuli has been modified to include sources for 2 texts (i.e. Source 1:..., Source 2:...). Similarly, the windows has been modified to allow highlight to take place on multiple locations within and across windows.

For each block, there will be a break once a set of 18 trials for particular technique has been completed. A pop-up with 30 seconds countdown will appear. Participant can click the button after the countdown to continue with the next technique for that block.

Between each block, there will be a popup to indiciate a break for the participant. However, this popup does not have a countdown. This is to provide the particpant with more flexibility into how he/she wants to rest. In the event that the timing may exceed the planned one, the participant can be advised to take a shorter break.

## Post-Experiment Questionnaire

We hope to evaluate the effectiveness of both techniques, hence the questions are repeated across both techniques. A preference from the user is also asked.

The score that participant provide is used for one of the measures.

Finally, participant is asked about the experiment in general; suggestions for improvements and any positive feedback.

SpongeBob SquarePants is a cute, cuddly, yellow, well-dressed sea sponge who is optimistic, friendly, nice, happy, loyal, funny, hard-woking, outgoing, selfless, sweet, innocent, forgiving, and very good-natured, and loves to have fun and silly. In a variety of episodes, he is seen as fairly intelligent and very capable, even though his silliness and his naive and annoying traits cause him to seem less intelligent than he truly is. 

His best friend is Patrick Star, and he has many other friends that he claims to also be is best friend, such as his pet Gary, Sandy Cheeks, and Squidward Tentacles. All of the main and minor characters have at least on one point shown a liking to SpongeBob, which shows that he is an overall very likable person, and it's just his annoying traits that are what cause some of the characters to not like him at times, but when he is not annoying, he proves to be very likable and a good sponge to have as a friend or to talk to.
